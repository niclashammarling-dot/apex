| 4 Config parity | ⚠ | WARNING | data/live_config.json:— | key 'tp_cooloff_hours' in demo but missing from live |
| 15 Calibration freshness | ⚠ | WARNING | data/calibration_done.txt:— | calibration last ran 2026-W24, current week 2026-W26 — catch-up may have failed |
| 22 Yahoo data pipeline health | ⚠ | WARNING | data/regime_result_cache.json | regime_result_cache.json is 15 days old (last: 2026-06-08) — EOD regime may not have run successfully this week |
| 33 Bayesian multiplier health | ⚠ | WARNING | data/bayesian_multiplier_stats.json | Stats file is from 2026-06-08, last trading day was 2026-06-22 — gate runner did not complete a full cycle or _persist_multiplier_stats() was removed |
| 50 L4 group constraint (live data) | ⚠ | WARNING | /home/runner/work/apex/apex/data/apex.db | apex.db not found — cannot verify L4 group constraint on executed trades |

| 2 Exception-catch coverage in tests | ⚠ | WARNING | test_gate_runners.py:— | Tests using side_effect=Exception do not assert DB insert mock call arguments. |
| 2 Exception-catch coverage in tests | ⚠ | WARNING | test_wallet.py:— | Tests using side_effect=Exception do not assert DB insert mock call arguments. |
| 7 Demo/live gate runner parity | ⚠ | WARNING | gate_runner.py: _persist_multiplier_stats | Function persists multiplier stats in demo but has no equivalent in live, potentially missing critical data logging. |
| 7 Demo/live gate runner parity | ⚠ | WARNING | gate_runner.py: _compute_bayesian_multipliers | Function computes Bayesian multipliers in demo but has no equivalent in live, potentially affecting trade sizing logic. |
| 7 Demo/live gate runner parity | ⚠ | WARNING | gate_runner.py: _log_summary | Log format in demo includes detailed lock information but may differ in live, affecting consistency in logging. |
| 7 Demo/live gate runner parity | ⚠ | WARNING | gate_runner_live.py: _run_l5_for_result | Lock 5 logic is present in live but not in demo, indicating a potential inconsistency in lock evaluation. |
| 7 Demo/live gate runner parity | ⚠ | WARNING | gate_runner_live.py: _evaluate | Live runner uses a different context builder and evaluation chain, which may lead to discrepancies in trade evaluation logic. |
| 8 General code health | ⚠ | WARNING | gate_runner.py:47 | Bare except block in risk path without logging in `_compute_bayesian_multipliers`. |
| 8 General code health | ⚠ | WARNING | gate_runner_live.py:97 | Bare except block in risk path without logging in `_record_live_trade`. |
| 8 General code health | ⚠ | INFO | gate_runner.py:75 | TODO/FIXME/HACK comment found. |
| 8 General code health | ⚠ | INFO | gate_runner_live.py:45 | Function `_evaluate` returns inconsistent types without caller guard. |
